UNIX makes programming easier
- pipelining allows for smooth flowing between programs independent of IO (since I/O devices are seen as files in the filesystem)
- formatless files - you don't need much information about a file other than where it is to obtain info from it, it's just a bunch of bytes
- hierarchical structure

Shell/command interpreter
- program that waits for input and requests programs
